### üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Installing requirements

 <font color="red">Quick warning</font>: Running on basic shell environments may break graphical elements<br> 
 but it will not break the functionality itself.<br><br>
Gaphical elements are fun, but if you don't really care about them, just go on and it<br> will function normally.<br><br>
In case you care about it, the recommended shell environments are:
- Windows Powershell (with or without OH-MY-POSH)
- Windows Terminal (modern windows terminal environment, just search it on search bar instead of CMD)
- ZSH
- BASH

If you enjoy customization, powerline fonts and nerd fonts are a plus, but are'nt required.

That's all folks.
